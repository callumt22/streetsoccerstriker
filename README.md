- In this repository are some C# code examples from an iOS game called Street Soccer Striker that was made within Unity.
- Street Soccer Striker is a level based football game, where players attempt to score goals in a range of different environments by setting the direction, power and curve on the ball. There are 60 levels with a range of different obstacles in each, and an action replay mode to rewatch the goals they have scored.

- "GameManager" is a script for loading and unloading scenes and the transitions between them.
- "ActionReplay" is a script for handling and storing data based on object position to create a replay.
